- Flexbox

### What I learned

No one is perfect, but one can aim to be the best at what they do. Through this challenge I have learnt a lot. The highlights of them are listed below.

1. <span> elements are inline and do not break the flow of the paragraph or heading.
2. hsl()/hsla() is another method to denote color through hue(color on the wheel), saturation(amount of color) and light(amount of black or white added)
3. To make the webpage scale according to device browser, we include set the viewport properties to allow proper scaling.
4. iusing media queries to set up breakpoints for changes in dimensions of the layout
5. It is always best to start with the mobile layout as it allows you to build upon that into larger dimensions.


### Continued development
1. The component is still not compleetly responsive and breaks on a lot of layouts. A further improvement to this would be a fully responsive component.
2. The spacings are a bit odd would need to learn efficient spacing rules
